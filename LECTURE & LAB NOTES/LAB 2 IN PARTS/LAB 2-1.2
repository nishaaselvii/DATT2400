//THIS WAS THE CODE PROF PASTED AND THEN ADD NEW VALUES 
//MINE IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EXCEPT MY NUMERICAL VALUES DIFFER
//THIS CODE CHANGES MORE BECAUSE PROF SAYS, "THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR RANDOM WALKING THING RN SO HE ALTERS IT MORE"
//i wanted to paste this just to show how he uses the global variables repetatively in order to add more depth to code without having to redo the draw voids
//**personal question - but my repasting the values multiple times, isn't it just the same thing?
